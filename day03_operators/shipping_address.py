Create a python file named shipping_address.py, and Declare the following variables:
                    name
                    building
                    street

                    state
                    zip code

    Use concatenation to print the full shipping address

        Ex:
            Given data:
                name = "Aaron Kissinger"
                building = 13621A
                street = "Legacy Circle"
                city = "Fairfax"
                state = "VA"
                zipCode = 22030
